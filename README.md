♿ Immersive Accessibility Simulator

An interactive VR/AR web application built with A-Frame to simulate real-world environments (hospital rooms, grocery stores, public spaces, etc.) for people with physical disabilities. The app provides adaptive, inclusive, and safe practice environments that promote independence, confidence, and social participation.

🚀 Problem Statement (DSMN 4)

People with physical disabilities often encounter barriers when accessing public spaces, attending social events, or performing daily activities, which limits independence and overall quality of life. Current solutions are inadequate, leading to social exclusion and reduced well-being.

This project addresses these issues by offering immersive, inclusive, and adaptive environments for training, rehabilitation, and empowerment.

🎯 Goals

Create realistic VR scenarios that simulate public and private spaces.

Provide adaptive navigation and assistive features for users with mobility limitations.

Enable safe practice of daily activities without physical risks.

Record interaction metrics to track progress.

Foster equity, empowerment, and social inclusion.

🏗 Features

🌍 Scenario Library: Hospital, Grocery Store, Social Events, and more.

🎮 Immersive VR/AR Environments: Built using A-Frame.

🧭 Accessible Navigation: WASD + cursor/gaze interaction for mobility-friendly use.

📊 Progress Tracking: Time, task completion, and performance metrics.

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Assistive Integration: Wheelchairs, smart mobility aids, motion sensors.

🏅 Gamification: Points, badges, and skill challenges.

⚙ Adaptive Personalization: AI-based scenario difficulty adjustment.
