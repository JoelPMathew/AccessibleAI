♿ Immersive Accessibility Simulator
An Interactive VR/AR Web Application for Inclusive Accessibility Training

📌 Problem Statement (DSMN 4)
People with physical disabilities often face barriers in:

🚪 Accessing public spaces

🎉 Attending social events

🛒 Performing daily activities

💡 Current accessibility solutions are frequently inadequate, leading to:

Reduced independence

Lower confidence

Negative impact on well-being

👉 Our Solution:
We create immersive, realistic environments that simulate daily challenges, enabling safe training, rehabilitation, and empowerment.

🎯 Goals
🏙 Realistic VR Scenarios → Practice daily tasks in immersive environments

🧭 Adaptive Navigation → Wheelchair-friendly, gaze-based, and WASD controls

🛡 Safe Practice → Low-risk simulations of real-world challenges

📊 Progress Tracking → Monitor task completion, interaction metrics, and skill growth

🌍 Social Inclusion → Foster independence, equity, and empowerment
